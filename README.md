**Survival_rate_with_AIDS_after_t_years.R**  
Survival rate x years after AIDS diagnosis, was reported by (Poorolajal et al., 2016) for x = 2,4,6 for AIDS patients that did not receive ART. To calculate the survival rate for any x >= 0,
the survival rate as function of time was fitted assuming it follows exponential decay.

**plots.py**  
Generating the data for the plot for one mode (e.g. "targeted_m_homo") takes ~35 min. on a medium-high 2016 PC build, totalling to a runtime of roughly 7 hours to generate all plots. 




**Parameters of the HIV model, description, reference.***  
`condom_usage`, proportion of sexual interactions that involve the use of condoms out of all interactions between two gender types, Reece et al. 2010.  
`condom_efficiency`, proportion of sexual interactions that do not result in the transmission of HIV out of all interactions that involve the use of condoms between two genders, Smith et al. 1999 and Weller et al. 1996.  

*If multiple empirical parameter values were reported, e.g. condom usage reported by heterosexual men and condom usage reported by heterosexual women the mean of the reported values was assigned as parameter value.

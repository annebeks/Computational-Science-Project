Survival rate x years after AIDS diagnosis, was reported by (Poorolajal et al., 2016) for x = 2,4,6 for AIDS patients that did not receive ART. To calculate the survival rate for any x >= 0,
the survival rate as function of time was fitted assuming it follows exponential decay. For details see "Survival_rate_with_AIDS_after_t_years.R"
